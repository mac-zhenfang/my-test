1. Sharding Mode
	if there is no ShardID specified
			for (int j = 0; j < 200; j++) {
			long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
			GridFSInputFile fs = myFS.createFile(new File("F://2.jpg"));
			fs.put("test1", "test");
			fs.put("test2", "test");
			fs.put("test3", "test");
			//fs.put("files_id", j);
	the files_id is the Sharding Key, but it is commneted, the perforamnce is very bad 
	and no data will be insert into physical db
2. GridFS in Replication Mode
	Sometimes it will be very slow (in Replication Mode)
